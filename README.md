# ðŸ“‚ path

A ZSH utility that helps you quickly copy file paths in various formats. Perfect for developers who frequently need to reference files in different contexts - from terminal commands to documentation.

## Features

- **Interactive menu** with 15+ path format options
- **Smart escaping** for paths with spaces and special characters

- **Works with files, directories, and commands**
- **Context-aware options** - only shows relevant formats

## Dependencies

- **zsh** - The script is written for ZSH shell

## Available Formats

The interactive menu provides these format options:

| Format | Example Output | Use Case |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Filename** | `README.md` | Just the filename |
| **Filename (No extension)** | `README` | Filename without extension |
| **Just the extension** | `md` | File extension only |
| **Parent Directory** | `/Users/name/Repos/path` | Directory containing the file |
| **Relative Path** | `../path/README.md` | Path relative to current directory |
| **Absolute Path** | `/Users/name/Repos/path/README.md` | Full system path |
| **Absolute Path (Escaped)** | `"/Users/name/My Docs/file.txt"` | Escaped for shell use |
| **Tilde Path** | `~/Repos/path/README.md` | Home-relative path |
| **Tilde Path (Escaped)** | `"~/My Docs/file.txt"` | Escaped home-relative path |
| **URI Encoded** | `%2FUsers%2Fname%2FRepos%2Fpath%2FREADME.md` | URL-safe encoding |
| **JSON String** | `"/Users/name/Repos/path/README.md"` | JSON-escaped string |
| **File URL** | `file:///Users/name/Repos/path/README.md` | File URL format |
| **HTML Link** | `<a href="file://...">README.md</a>` | HTML anchor tag |

Note: Some options only appear when relevant (e.g., escaped versions only show for paths with special characters).

## Tips

- Use arrow keys to navigate the menu
- Press Enter to copy the selected format to clipboard
- Press Esc or Ctrl+C to cancel without copying
- The "Reveal in Finder" and "Open" options execute commands instead of copying
